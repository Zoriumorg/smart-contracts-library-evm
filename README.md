# Smart Contracts Library (EVM) - Zoriumorg

Welcome to the **Smart Contracts Library (EVM)** repository by Zoriumorg! This is an open-source collection of Solidity smart contracts designed for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Whether you're a beginner learning blockchain development or an experienced developer building decentralized applications (dApps), this repository provides a variety of contracts to explore, use, and contribute to.

The goal of this project is to create a reusable, well-documented library of smart contracts that anyone can freely access, modify, and deploy. Feel free to dive into the code, submit pull requests, or suggest new contract ideas!

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into folders, each containing a specific type of smart contract or dApp example. Below is an overview of the current contents:

- **`hello-world-dapp`**  
  A basic decentralized application (dApp) example to get started with Solidity and EVM development.  

- **`multi-storage-dapp`**  
  A dApp demonstrating how to store and manage multiple data types or records on the blockchain.  

- **`reown-wallet-connect`**  
  A contract integrating wallet connectivity (e.g., for use with tools like WalletConnect) to enable secure user interactions.  

- **`simple-storage-number`**  
  A simple contract for storing and retrieving a single number value on the blockchain.  

- **`simple-storage-dapp`**  
  A basic dApp example showcasing storage and retrieval of data using a smart contract.  
 
- **`voting-contract`**  
  A contract implementing a voting system, allowing users to cast votes and tally results on-chain.  

**Note:** The `.DS_Store` file is a macOS system file and not part of the functional contracts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To work with these contracts, you'll need the following tools:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for package management.
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for smart contract development and deployment.
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or another wallet for interacting with the Ethereum network.
- An Ethereum testnet (e.g., Rinkeby, Ropsten) or a local blockchain like [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zoriumorg/smart-contracts-library-evm.git
   cd smart-contracts-library-evm
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder of the contract you want to use (e.g., `cd simple-storage-dapp`).
3. Install dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Compile and deploy the contract using your preferred framework (e.g., Truffle or Hardhat). Refer to each folder’s documentation for specific instructions.

## Contributing

This is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community! Here’s how you can get involved:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Add your smart contract or improve an existing one.
4. Update the README or add a sub-README in the relevant folder with details about your contribution.
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.

### Guidelines
- Ensure your code is well-commented and follows Solidity best practices.
- Test your contracts thoroughly (e.g., using unit tests in Truffle or Hardhat).
- Avoid committing sensitive data like private keys or API keys.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the contracts, deploy them to a testnet, or integrate them into your own projects. Each folder contains a specific contract or dApp example—check the individual files or sub-READMEs (if available) for detailed instructions.

For example, to deploy the `simple-storage-number` contract:
1. Navigate to `simple-storage-number/`.
2. Update the deployment script with your network details.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate --network rinkeby
   ```
