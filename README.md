# Smart Contracts Library (EVM) - Zoriumorg

Welcome to the **Smart Contracts Library (EVM)** repository by Zoriumorg! This is an open-source collection of Solidity smart contracts designed for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Whether you're a beginner learning blockchain development or an experienced developer building decentralized applications (dApps), this repository provides a variety of contracts to explore, use, and contribute to.

The goal of this project is to create a reusable, well-documented library of smart contracts that anyone can freely access, modify, and deploy. Feel free to dive into the code, submit pull requests, or suggest new contract ideas!

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into folders, each containing a specific type of smart contract or dApp example. Below is an overview of the current contents:

### Decentralized Applications (dApps)
- **`hello-world-dapp`**  
  A basic decentralized application (dApp) example to get started with Solidity and EVM development.  
- **`multi-storage-dapp`**  
  A dApp demonstrating how to store and manage multiple data types or records on the blockchain.  
- **`reown-wallet-connect`**  
  A contract integrating wallet connectivity (e.g., for use with tools like WalletConnect) to enable secure user interactions.  
- **`simple-storage-dapp`**  
  A basic dApp example showcasing storage and retrieval of data using a smart contract.  
- **`simple-storage-number`**  
  A simple contract for storing and retrieving a single number value on the blockchain.  

### Token Standards
- **`ERC20BasicToken`**  
  A standard ERC20 token implementation with basic functionalities like transfer, approve, and balance tracking.  
- **`ERC20WithAllowance`**  
  An ERC20 token with enhanced allowance features for delegated spending.  
- **`ERC721NFTContract`**  
  An ERC721 non-fungible token (NFT) contract for creating unique digital assets.  
- **`ERC1155Contract`**  
  An advanced ERC1155 multi-token standard contract supporting both fungible and non-fungible tokens.  

### Financial Contracts
- **`CrowdsaleContract`**  
  A contract for conducting a fixed-rate token sale, allowing users to buy ERC20 tokens with ETH.  
- **`SimpleLendingContract`**  
  A basic lending contract for borrowing and lending assets on-chain.  
- **`TokenVestingContract`**  
  A vesting contract to release tokens gradually over time to beneficiaries.  
- **`StackingV1Contract`**  
  A staking contract allowing users to lock tokens and earn rewards.  
- **`CharityDonationContract`**  
  A contract for managing and distributing charitable donations transparently.  
- **`PayableContract`**  
  A simple contract demonstrating payable functions to receive Ether.  

### Utility Contracts
- **`AccessControlContract`**  
  A contract implementing role-based access control for secure permission management.  
- **`GasOptimizedCounter`**  
  A gas-optimized counter contract for efficient on-chain counting operations.  
- **`AdvancedGasOptimizedCounter`**  
  An enhanced version of the gas-optimized counter with additional features.  
- **`RandomNumberContract`**  
  A contract for generating random numbers on-chain (e.g., using a secure oracle).  
- **`FaucetContract`**  
  A faucet contract to distribute test tokens or Ether on testnets.  

### Governance and Security
- **`MultiSigWallet`**  
  A multi-signature wallet requiring multiple approvals for transactions, enhancing security for fund management.  
- **`TimeLockContract`**  
  A contract that locks funds or actions for a specified duration before they can be executed. Useful for delayed transactions or governance.  
- **`VotingContract`**  
  A contract implementing a voting system, allowing users to cast votes and tally results on-chain.  
- **`EscrowContract`**  
  A secure escrow contract to hold funds until predefined conditions are met.  

### Advanced Features
- **`AuctionContract`**  
  A contract for conducting on-chain auctions (e.g., English or Dutch auctions).  
- **`UpgradeableProxyContract`**  
  A proxy contract enabling upgrades to logic contracts while preserving state (e.g., using a value tracker V1).  

**Note:** The `.DS_Store` file is a macOS system artifact and not part of the functional contracts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To work with these contracts, you'll need the following tools:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for package management.
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for smart contract development and deployment.
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or another wallet for interacting with the Ethereum network.
- An Ethereum testnet (e.g., Rinkeby, Ropsten) or a local blockchain like [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zoriumorg/smart-contracts-library-evm.git
   cd smart-contracts-library-evm
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder of the contract you want to use (e.g., `cd simple-storage-dapp`).
3. Install dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Compile and deploy the contract using your preferred framework (e.g., Truffle or Hardhat). Refer to each folder’s documentation for specific instructions.

## Contributing

This is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community! Here’s how you can get involved:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Add your smart contract or improve an existing one.
4. Update the README or add a sub-README in the relevant folder with details about your contribution.
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.

### Guidelines
- Ensure your code is well-commented and follows Solidity best practices.
- Test your contracts thoroughly (e.g., using unit tests in Truffle or Hardhat).
- Avoid committing sensitive data like private keys or API keys.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the contracts, deploy them to a testnet, or integrate them into your own projects. Each folder contains a specific contract or dApp example—check the individual files or sub-READMEs (if available) for detailed instructions.

For example, to deploy the `simple-storage-number` contract:
1. Navigate to `simple-storage-number/`.
2. Update the deployment script with your network details.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate --network rinkeby
   ```

### Notes:
1. **Organization**: I grouped the contracts into logical categories (dApps, Token Standards, Financial Contracts, etc.) to make the README more readable and professional.
2. **Assumptions**: I assumed these are Solidity contracts for EVM and added generic setup instructions. If your repo uses a specific framework (e.g., only Hardhat), let me know, and I can adjust it.
3. **Dates**: I omitted commit dates and messages (e.g., "2 weeks ago") as they’re not typically included in a README unless tracking a changelog, which can be added separately if desired.
4. **Customization**: Replace "Zoriumorg" and the repo URL with your actual organization/username and repository details.
