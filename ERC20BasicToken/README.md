# ERC20BasicToken

A basic implementation of the ERC20 token standard in Solidity.

## Overview
This is a simple ERC20 token contract that implements the core functionality of a fungible token on Ethereum blockchain.

## Features
- Token name: "Basic Token"
- Token symbol: "BTK"
- Decimals: 18
- Basic transfer functionality
- Approve/TransferFrom allowance system
- Minting capability

## Contract Details
- **Solidity Version**: ^0.8.0
- **License**: MIT

## Functions

### constructor(uint256 initialSupply)
- Initializes the contract with an initial supply
- All tokens are assigned to the contract deployer

### transfer(address to, uint256 value)
- Transfers tokens to a specified address
- Requirements:
  - Valid recipient address
  - Sufficient balance

### approve(address spender, uint256 value)
- Approves a spender to transfer tokens on behalf of the owner

### transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value)
- Transfers tokens from one address to another using allowance
- Requirements:
  - Valid from/to addresses
  - Sufficient balance
  - Sufficient allowance

### mint(address to, uint256 value)
- Creates new tokens and assigns them to specified address
- No access restriction (anyone can mint)

## Events
- Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)
- Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value)

## Deployment
1. Install dependencies (e.g., using Hardhat or Truffle)
2. Compile the contract
3. Deploy with desired initialSupply parameter
```
Example using Hardhat:
```javascript
const Token = await ethers.getContractFactory("ERC20BasicToken");
const token = await Token.deploy(initialSupply);
await token.deployed();
```

## Security Notes
- No access control on minting
- No pause functionality
- Basic implementation without additional safety features
```

# ERC20BasicToken1

An enhanced implementation of the ERC20 token standard with additional features and security controls.

## Overview
This is an advanced ERC20 token contract with additional functionality and security features compared to the basic version.

## Features
- Token name: "Basic Token"
- Token symbol: "BTK"
- Decimals: 18
- Transfer functionality with pause capability
- Approve/TransferFrom with allowance management
- Minting (restricted to owner)
- Burning capability
- Ownership management
- Pause/unpause functionality
- Allowance increase/decrease functions

## Contract Details
- **Solidity Version**: ^0.8.0
- **License**: MIT

## Functions

### constructor(uint256 initialSupply)
- Sets deployer as owner
- Creates initial token supply

### transfer(address to, uint256 value)
- Transfers tokens when not paused
- Requirements:
  - Contract not paused
  - Valid address
  - Sufficient balance

### approve(address spender, uint256 value)
- Sets allowance when not paused

### transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value)
- Transfers using allowance when not paused

### mint(address to, uint256 value)
- Creates new tokens (owner only)

### burn(uint256 value)
- Destroys tokens from caller's balance
- Requirements:
  - Contract not paused
  - Sufficient balance

### increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue)
- Increases spender allowance

### decreaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 subtractedValue)
- Decreases spender allowance

### transferOwnership(address newOwner)
- Transfers contract ownership (owner only)

### pause() / unpause()
- Controls contract pause state (owner only)

## Events
- Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)
- Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value)
- Mint(address indexed to, uint256 value)
- Burn(address indexed from, uint256 value)
- OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner)
- Paused(address account)
- Unpaused(address account)

## Deployment
1. Install dependencies
2. Compile the contract
3. Deploy with initialSupply
```
Example using Hardhat:
```javascript
const Token = await ethers.getContractFactory("ERC20BasicToken1");
const token = await Token.deploy(initialSupply);
await token.deployed();
```

## Security Features
- Owner-only minting
- Pause functionality for emergency stops
- Ownership transfer capability
- SafeMath implicitly used (Solidity ^0.8.0)
```

### Key Differences Between the Contracts

1. **Access Control**
   - ERC20BasicToken: Anyone can mint tokens
   - ERC20BasicToken1: Only owner can mint, includes ownership management

2. **Pause Functionality**
   - ERC20BasicToken: No pause capability
   - ERC20BasicToken1: Owner can pause/unpause transfers

3. **Token Burning**
   - ERC20BasicToken: No burning capability
   - ERC20BasicToken1: Users can burn their tokens

4. **Allowance Management**
   - ERC20BasicToken: Basic approve only
   - ERC20BasicToken1: Includes increase/decrease allowance functions

5. **Ownership**
   - ERC20BasicToken: No explicit ownership
   - ERC20BasicToken1: Explicit owner with transfer capability

6. **Events**
   - ERC20BasicToken: Basic Transfer and Approval events
   - ERC20BasicToken1: Additional Mint, Burn, OwnershipTransferred, Paused, Unpaused events

7. **Security**
   - ERC20BasicToken: Basic implementation
   - ERC20BasicToken1: More secure with additional controls and modifiers

### Implementation Considerations
- ERC20BasicToken is simpler and cheaper to deploy but less secure
- ERC20BasicToken1 is more feature-rich and secure but more expensive in gas costs
- Choose ERC20BasicToken for simple testing/prototyping
- Choose ERC20BasicToken1 for production use requiring security features

Both contracts implement the ERC20 standard but ERC20BasicToken1 is more suitable for real-world deployment due to its enhanced security and management features.
